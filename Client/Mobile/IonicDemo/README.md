Ionicview is a tool for Android and iOS that can be used for quickly loading apps through ionic's upload feature. Install Ionicview on a mobile device, then upload the app by using "$ionic upload" in the application's root directory and enter in the correct Ionicview email address and password to quickly test an app.
