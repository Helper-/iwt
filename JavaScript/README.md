The examples here would be found in Chapters 1 - 8
  - Types
  - Classes
  - OOP
  - functions
  - Math, String, Date, etc.
  - RegExp
  - New Emerging ES6 stuff
  
 What is not here are the platform specific things such as for the browser (DOM, XHR, events, fetch API, canvas, etc.)
 Each of the platform APIs are in the individual platform directory under either
 client (for browser and encapsulated browser) or server (for NodeJS)
